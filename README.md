# DryMIDI
DryMIDI is the .NET library to work with MIDI files. You need to understand MIDI file structure to effectively work with the library since it operates by low-level MIDI objects like message and track chunk. You will not find here any high-level entities like note or chord. I plan to implement this logic in another library in the future.
