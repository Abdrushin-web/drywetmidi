# Support

Here you'll find information about how to create good issues on the DryWetMIDI so I (author of the library) can help you with your problem. The main rule – provide as many details as possible. I'm developing the library in my spare time and don't ask money for it. Please respect my time. Messages like "Something bad happened" will be without my attention.

1. Is your question related with specific MIDI file? Then provide either this file or sample one to reproduce the error.
2. Do you get error message during the build or an exception in runtime? Don't forget to attach the error text or/and screenshot of it.
3. Provide your code and point me to the place there where the error occurred.
4. What is your operating system?
5. What version of the library do you use?
